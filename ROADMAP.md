# Fast Food Conglomerate Roadmap

## Given more time I would...

### Add the functionality for the cart to render unique items only with a count next to them.

### Style the app so it is mobile friendly

> flex box got a little messy in the menu component

### Write tests for each of my components with user-oriented design (BDD)

> I also always like to write e2e tests for the happy path and have that in the ci/cd mix.

### Style buttons and components differently
